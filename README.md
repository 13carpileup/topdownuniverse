# Top Down Universe

A web-based universe simulator based on Newton's law of universal gravitation.

## Controls

- Click and drag the background to move your view around the 'universe'. 
- Click and drag on any object to move it; try flinging it to give it velocity.
- Use the controls at the bottom to create a new object, which will follow your mouse until you click.
- Double click an object to start following it.

## Tech

All computations are done client-side. The graphics of the universe are rendered with PixiJS, a 2D WebGL renderer.
